### Functions (19 total)
- ✅ 8 query functions (read-only)
- ✅ 6 mutation functions (write operations)
- ✅ All tested and validated

### Configuration
- ✅ `.env` updated with Convex URL
- ✅ Python client ready (`backend/db_convex.py`)
- ✅ TypeScript types generated

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Migrate Your Data (Optional)

If you have existing SQLite data:

```powershell
python migrate_to_convex.py
```

This will copy all records from SQLite to Convex.

### 2. Test the Connection

```python
# test_convex.py
import asyncio
from backend.db_convex import get_store

async def test():
    store = get_store()
    
    # Get stats
    stats = await store.get_stats()
    print(f"📊 Total records: {stats['total_records']}")
    
    # Test query
    all_records = await store.get_all()
    print(f"📋 Records: {len(all_records)}")
    
    await store.close()

asyncio.run(test())
```

### 3. Restart Your Server

Your `.env` is already configured with:
```env
DATABASE_TYPE=convex
CONVEX_URL=https://unique-heron-539.convex.cloud
```

Just restart:
```powershell
# Server will auto-reload if already running with --reload
# Or manually restart:
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

✅ **Deletions** - Remove from all views instantly  
✅ **Status changes** - Live progress tracking

### Example Flow:

```
Voice: "Mark TD045 released"

## 📱 Next: Frontend Integration (Optional)

Want real-time updates in your UI?

```typescript
// React example
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

function ReportsList() {
  // Auto-refreshes when data changes!
  const reports = useQuery(api.psur.getAll);
  
  return (
    <ul>
      {reports?.map(r => (
        <li key={r._id}>{r.td_number} - {r.product_name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## 📚 Available Functions

### Queries (Read-Only)

```python
# Get single record
record = await store.find_by_td("TD045")

# Get all duplicates
records = await store.find_all_by_td("TD045")

# Search
results = await store.find_by_query("Hyadase", limit=10)

# Filter
overdue = await store.filter_records(overdue_only=True)
jeff_items = await store.filter_records(writer="Jeff")
class_iii = await store.filter_records(classification="III")

# Get all
all = await store.get_all()

# Stats
stats = await store.get_stats()
```

### Mutations (Write Operations)

```python
# Create
td = await store.add_record({
    "product_name": "New Product",
    "class": "IIa",
    "writer": "Sarah",
    "due_date": "2025-12-31"
})

# Update
await store.update_record("TD045", {
    "status": "Released",
    "due_date": "2025-06-30"
})

# Delete
await store.delete_record("TD045")

# Bulk update
count = await store.bulk_update_status(
    {"writer": "Jeff"}, 
    "Released"
)

# Add comment
await store.add_comment("TD045", "Routed in MC")

# Link references
await store.link_references(
    "TD045",
    mc_url="https://mc.example.com/doc123",
    sp_url="https://sharepoint.example.com/item456"
)
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to Convex

```
Error: Failed to fetch
```

**Solution**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify `CONVEX_URL` in `.env`
3. Ensure functions deployed: `npx convex deploy`

### Function not found

```
Error: No function psur:getByTd
```

**Solution**:
```powershell
npx convex deploy
```

### Type errors in TypeScript

```powershell
# Regenerate types
npx convex dev --once
```

---

## 🎁 Bonus Features

### Auto-Generated TD Numbers

Don't provide `td_number`? Convex auto-generates:
```python
td = await store.add_record({"product_name": "New Item"})
# Returns: "TD089" (next available)
```

### Flexible Due Dates

Set **any date** you want:
```python
await store.update_record("TD045", {"due_date": "2025-05-15"})
```

Computed dates are just defaults!

### Duplicate TD Support

Multiple products under one TD:
```python
# First product
await store.add_record({"td_number": "TD045", "product_name": "Product A"})

# Second product (same TD!)
await store.add_record({"td_number": "TD045", "product_name": "Product B"})

# Get both
records = await store.find_all_by_td("TD045")
# Returns: [Product A, Product B]
```
