# Duplicate TD Number Support - Test Results

## Issue Diagnosis

The database schema was **already correct** (no UNIQUE constraint on td_number), but the `add_psur_item` tool had a bug where it wasn't properly passing the explicit `td_number` from tool arguments to the store.

## Root Cause

In `backend/server.py`, the `add_psur_item` tool handler was only checking `EXACT_HEADERS` keys and missing direct field names like `td_number`. When users specified `td_number: "TD888"`, the store's auto-generation logic would assign a new number (e.g., TD889) instead.

## Fix Applied

Updated the tool handler to accept both canonical field names AND direct field names:

```python
elif name == "add_psur_item":
    new_record = {}
    # Check EXACT_HEADERS mappings
    for canon in EXACT_HEADERS.keys():
        v = args.get(canon)
        if v is not None:
            new_record[canon] = v
    
    # ALSO check direct field names
    for field in ["td_number", "psur_number", "class", "type", ...]:
        if field in args and field not in new_record:
            new_record[field] = args[field]
    
    td_number = store.add_record(new_record)
```

## Test Results

### âœ… Direct Database API
- Creating records with duplicate TD numbers via `store.add_record()`: **WORKS**
- Multiple products can share the same TD number

### âœ… Agent Tool Interface
- Creating records with duplicate TD numbers via `add_psur_item` tool: **WORKS**
- Explicit `td_number` parameter is now respected

### âœ… Retrieval
- `find_all_by_td("TD888")` correctly returns all records with that TD
- Statistics correctly report duplicate TD numbers

### âœ… Example Output
```
ðŸ“Š Total TD888 records in database: 3
   1. Product Alpha (PSUR: PSUR888A, Writer: Alice)
   2. Product Beta (PSUR: PSUR888B, Writer: Bob)
   3. Product Gamma (PSUR: PSUR888C, Writer: Charlie)
```

## Usage Examples

### Voice Agent Command
```
"Add a PSUR under TD045 for New Catheter Product, Class IIb, writer Sarah"
```

The agent will call:
```json
{
  "name": "add_psur_item",
  "args": {
    "td_number": "TD045",
    "product_name": "New Catheter Product",
    "class": "IIb",
    "writer": "Sarah"
  }
}
```

### Direct API Call
```python
from backend.db_store import get_store

store = get_store()
store.add_record({
    "td_number": "TD045",
    "psur_number": "PSUR045B",
    "product_name": "Second Product",
    "writer": "John"
})
```

## Tools for Managing Duplicates

1. **get_all_duplicates** - Retrieve all products under one TD
   ```json
   {"name": "get_all_duplicates", "args": {"td_number": "TD045"}}
   ```

2. **get_stats** - See which TDs have multiple products
   ```json
   {"name": "get_stats", "args": {}}
   // Returns: {"duplicate_td_numbers": ["TD045", "TD088", ...]}
   ```

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED

Duplicate TD numbers are fully supported across:
- Database schema (no UNIQUE constraint)
- Direct store API
- Agent tool interface
- Retrieval and statistics
